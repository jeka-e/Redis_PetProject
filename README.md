# Redis Little Project

Practice with Redis DB. Performed CRUD actions, sorting, some sort of aggregation.

Created an imgainary running race, where athletes' trackers send the location and HR every second. The key is formed from an athletes id and number of seconds passed from the start of a race, value represent distance passed and HR score. Also, personal info of participants was stored in the same db.
